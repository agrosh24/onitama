# onitama all possible cards generator
holds all the files to make 12926 custom onitama cards<br/>
the original game has cards that can move to, at maximum, 24 different spaces<br/>
each card can either move to 2, 3, or 4 of the 24 spaces<br/>
so, all combinations of these 2, 3, or 4 space cards, on any of the 24 spaces, makes 12926 cards<br/>
the card names will be found by randomly generating iNaturalist species ids<br/>
and the quotes will be picked at random from a few old texts<br/>
they will all be generated as image files so that hopefully they can be loaded into a tabletop simulator mod
