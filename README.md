# onitama all possible cards generator\n
holds all the files to make 12926 custom onitama cards
the original game has cards that can move to, at maximum, 24 different spaces
each card can either move to 2, 3, or 4 of the 24 spaces
so, all combinations of these 2, 3, or 4 space cards, on any of the 24 spaces, makes 12926 cards
the card names will be found by randomly generating iNaturalist species ids
and the quotes will be picked at random from a few old texts
they will all be generated as image files so that hopefully they can be loaded into a tabletop simulator mod
